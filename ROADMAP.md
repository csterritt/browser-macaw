### Roadmap of things to implement

In no particular order:

- Theme switching
- Dave G's idea of if there are no results, offer to do a Google/DDG/etc. search
- Keyboard control (like how BP lets you close the window with the Escape key)
- Build the signed application
- Write the "About..." page with links to the icon and its license
- Write the informational github website copy
