#### This application is just a different "front end" (the bit you see) for the wonderful:

[BrowserParrot application](https://browserparrot.com/)

Notably, BrowserParrot builds the database that this program uses. You'll need to have it
running (or have run it) in order for BrowserMacaw to be able to search for anything.

I just got on my SQL shoes and put a more complicated (but powerful!) user interface on
BrowserParrot's data.

**HELP TEXT COMING SOON** but I sincerely hope that the text above the "Search" tab's 
entry fields are comprehensible.
